# ⚡ Rent-A-Madhav — A Neon Sci-Fi Portfolio Experience  

Rent-A-Madhav is a fully interactive, multi-page, neon-themed website that showcases different “models” of Madhav — each representing a humorous, exaggerated version of myself with unique abilities, quirks, and chaotic energy.

The project blends UI design, sci-fi aesthetics, animations, and personality-driven branding into one fun experience.
